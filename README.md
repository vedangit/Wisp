# Wisp 🪶

> A free-form to-do list on an open canvas. Click. Create. Drag. Done.

---

## What is this?

Wisp is a dead-simple, no-rules to-do app where **you click anywhere to drop notes**. It's like sticky notes had a baby with your whiteboard — and then decided to be minimal and fast.

There are no lists, categories, or folders. Just a blank canvas and your thoughts.

---

## Why?

Most to-do apps ask you to fit into their system — tags, priorities, due dates, sub-tasks, whatever.  
Wisp flips that. It’s just you and a space to think.

This is for:
- People who like messy desks.
- People who think spatially.
- People who want to **just start writing** without setting up structure.

## Real talk

Wisp is a tool I wanted and couldn’t find.  
So I built it. Use it if it helps. Fork it if you want to make it yours.
